## why dsa?
data structure refers to how data is organized


## Arrays
is one of the most basic data structure in computer science

## size :
the size of an array refers to how many data elements an array holds
for example we have : array =["coke", "fanta" , "sprite"]
the size of the array above is 3

## index:
the index of an array is the number that identifies where the piece of data lives in an array
for our example above the index for coke is 0 and that of sprite is 2

## there are 4 basic operations that helps a user to interact with Arrays
- Read: with the read operation a user looks for an element at a specific index
- Search: with the search operation the user looks for a particular value within an array
- Insert: adding a new value to our data structure 
- Delete:  removing a value from our data structure

## NB:
- we measure the speed of code or code efficiency by how many steps it takes not by how much time it takes
this is because the time that a piece of code may take to complete may differ base oon the type of
hardware it runs on
- also, the speed of an operation can be referred to as th time complexity, the effeciency, performance or runtime#
