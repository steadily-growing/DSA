## Why algorithms matter?
    An algorithm is a set of instructions for completing a specific task.
    there are some algorithms that can only be explored when we look at a specific type of data that.
    Here we will be looking at ordered arrays.
    yes! ordered arrays are a type of data structure that in reperesented in order.


### Some operations in ordered arrays:
- Insert : inserting at the end of an ordered array will take N+1 steps for N elements and in the worst case scenario inserting at the beginning of an ordered array for N elements will take N + 2 steps
- Search:
### Nb:
- when searching in an ordered array one can make use of another operation known as the BNARY SEARCH operation
### Binary Search
- STEP 1: we begin this search by the central cell
