### Big O Notation:
    if there are N data elements hoe many steps will the algorithm take
    if an algorithm takes N steps for N data elements it's big Oh of N is O(N). Also, that algorithm has a linear time(time complexity). 
    Readong in an array takes just one step and the big o for that operation is O(1) which is a constant time.
    The soul of an algorithm:
        how will an algorithms performance change as the data increases. Comparing O(N) to O(1) we can vividly see that as the number of data elements increase the number of steps increses for O(N) and for O(1) the steps remain the same no matter the increase in data. For big O notation we mostly consider the worstcase scenario.For an operation like a linear search, the best case scenario is O(1) and the worst case O(N).
        In binary search the alrgorithm has a big O of Olog(N), logarithm briefly explained is how many times a number can be halved to be left with 1
